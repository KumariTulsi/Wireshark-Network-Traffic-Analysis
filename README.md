# Wireshark-Network-Traffic-Analysis
Hands-on project on analyzing network traffic using Wireshark to detect anomalies and suspicious activity.


## Objective
The aim of this project was to understand and analyze network traffic using Wireshark to detect anomalies and suspicious activity.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Kali Linux / Ubuntu
- TryHackMe (Wireshark: The Basics)

## Methodology
1. Installed and configured Wireshark  
2. Used TryHackMe "Wireshark: The Basics" lab  
3. Applied filters (`http`, `tcp.port == 80`, `ip.addr == X.X.X.X`)  
4. Analyzed packets (TCP handshake, DNS queries, suspicious activity)  
5. Captured evidence with screenshots  

## Findings
- Suspicious DNS requests detected  
- Multiple failed TCP connection attempts  
- Unencrypted HTTP traffic observed  

## Conclusion
This project improved my SOC Analyst skills by practicing packet analysis, filtering, and identifying suspicious traffic.
